I think whether people in modern society have enough leisure time depends on their financial situation. If you’re wealthy, you can afford to enjoy your time, but if you're not, you might need to work harder to support your family. However, I also believe that some rich people still work hard because they want to stay healthy and fulfill their goals. For them, working hard might feel like a way to release stress

Yes, I strongly believe that maintaining a healthy balance between work and leisure is essential. In today’s fast-paced world, people are under increasing pressure to meet deadlines and achieve targets, which often leads to stress and burnout. Without proper breaks or time to unwind, both physical and mental health can suffer significantly.

While it's true that consistent effort leads to improvement—like the saying 'practice makes perfect'—working non-stop without rest can actually reduce overall efficiency. Leisure activities such as spending time with family, exercising, or simply enjoying a hobby allow the brain to reset and the body to recover, which in turn improves focus and productivity when returning to work.

Moreover, maintaining this balance is not only beneficial for individual well-being but also contributes to long-term career success. People who manage their time wisely and know when to pause tend to be more creative, motivated, and emotionally resilient. Therefore, I think striking a balance between work and rest isn't just important—it's absolutely necessary for a fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle
