I think whether people in modern society have enough leisure time depends on their financial situation. If you’re wealthy, you can afford to enjoy your time, but if you're not, you might need to work harder to support your family. However, I also believe that some rich people still work hard because they want to stay healthy and fulfill their goals. For them, working hard might feel like a way to release stress

Yes, I strongly believe that maintaining a healthy balance between work and leisure is essential. In today’s fast-paced world, people are under increasing pressure to meet deadlines and achieve targets, which often leads to stress and burnout. Without proper breaks or time to unwind, both physical and mental health can suffer significantly.

While it's true that consistent effort leads to improvement—like the saying 'practice makes perfect'—working non-stop without rest can actually reduce overall efficiency. Leisure activities such as spending time with family, exercising, or simply enjoying a hobby allow the brain to reset and the body to recover, which in turn improves focus and productivity when returning to work.

Moreover, maintaining this balance is not only beneficial for individual well-being but also contributes to long-term career success. People who manage their time wisely and know when to pause tend to be more creative, motivated, and emotionally resilient. Therefore, I think striking a balance between work and rest isn't just important—it's absolutely necessary for a fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle

To be honest, in my free time, I usually make a couple of cups of coffee. As a student, studying can be quite tiring, so making coffee helps me relax and unwind. It also helps me recharge and focus better on my classes.

Generally speaking, if my friends invite me to go out, I will go, but I prefer to stay at home most of the time. I enjoy spending time alone because it helps me relax. Going out often means a long trip, and sometimes I don’t enjoy exercising. Additionally, I find that staying at home allows me to unwind more easily.

A tremendous shift has occurred in the way people read today. For example, many people now prefer reading online rather than offline, such as reading newspapers or books in print. I believe that reading books online is a positive trend because we can access almost anything on the internet for free. This easy access to information encourages the sharing of knowledge, which in turn boosts human innovation.

Tourism has evolved a lot over the years, with people exploring places they’ve never been before, which makes sense in today’s world. However, I believe that tourism can have a negative impact on nature. When large numbers of tourists visit natural environments, they often cause damage to the local ecosystem, whether through pollution, habitat destruction, or the strain on local resources. While tourism brings economic benefits to many areas, it’s important to consider the long-term effects on the environment. So, in my opinion, tourism is not always beneficial to nature.
