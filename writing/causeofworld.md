When it came to the concrete areas which was undergoing land degradation, the  predominant counterpart was the Europe, with 25 percent of the land degrated in total,consituted with 9.8 percent destoryed by deforestation, 7.7 percent by over-cultivation and 5.5 percent by over-grazing.Alough the Oceania took the second place, at 13 percent,but the palce which was threaten by the over-grazing reached the highest percentage of 11.3,meanwhile, the factor of over-cultivation was even zero.Besides, the remainder was the deforestation, which took up 1.7 percent.The last but not the least, the North America was the least polluted area, owning only 5 percentage of land facing the degradation.The reasons were ranging from 0.2 percent to 3.3 percent.
Above all, the Europe faced with the largest land pollution,while the North America was the least polluted area.When it came to gobal land degradation,the over-grazing accounted for most,while the remainder took the least.
