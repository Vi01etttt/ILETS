With the growing requirement of video games, there is a considerable debate over what kinds of influence video games pose to the players' mental health. From my perspective, video games bring more achievement than threat.
On the one hand, video games not only boost players' intelligence but also enhance their eyesight. With splendid visual performance and attractive stories, video games can be used for acquiring knowledge and practicing special skills.   For instance, the game "Battlefield" describes a series of real stories during World War II, and make a ever authentic simulation of battlefield, which improves players recognize about cruel war. Besides, another game called "PC Building Simulator" contributes to enhancing players' build PC capability, which makes online video games training more mature.Meanwhile, when costmers choose a game, they always take the educational value into account. What impresses the gaming field is that the success of "The Legend of Zleda", which contains basic physical rule in the game. It can be imaged that teachers could use it to teach students about the items movement vividly.
On the other hand, addicting to video games poses a tremendous threat to players. Especially when it comes to teenagers, who are vulnerable to internet, playing computer games for a long time has become their comfort zone. As the consequence, they tend to rely on computer games to get rid of the pain from reality and relationship. The trouble followed, not only physical exhaustion but also mental stress makes them struggle to live.
In conclusion, video game is a double-edged sword. What is important is not never to prevent using it, but to take advantage of its potential as a training stuff.
